Source Content:
	
	We are going to build a website around music and its different
	genres. Our home page will be a modern, welcoming page emphasizing
	the characteristics and benefits of music, which we will break down
	into (atleast) 3 seperate genres. Each page will explain the genre,
	using info from wikipedia or a different site. 

	What makes our site cool is that it will have sample songs for each genre,
	probably soundcloud embeds, and a list of the leading artists in that genre, 
	and ways to get connected with them. This might sound like a lot of work, but
	I think once we lay out the pages it will be easier than you think.

	We can decide later on which genres to use, color scheme, etc. I think we should also
	have an extra page unrelated to being just informational, maybe something cool.
